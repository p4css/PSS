Data with many cases (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity. When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value.\n",

      "big data is a field that treats ways to analyze systematically extract information from or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional dataprocessing application software data with many cases rows offer greater statistical power while data with higher complexity more attributes or columns may lead to a higher false discovery rate big data challenges include capturing data data storage data analysis search sharing transfer visualization querying updating information privacy and data source big data was originally associated with three key concepts volume variety and velocity when we handle big data we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens therefore big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and value\n",
      "current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics user behavior analytics or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from data and seldom to a particular size of data set there is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large but thats not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem\n",
